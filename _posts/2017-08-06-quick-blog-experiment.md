title: Quick Blog Experiment
---

I created this blog to see how fast I could get a workable blog up and running, using to the maximum extent tools that I use regularly - notably Github & markdown files.

That clearly started me off with `Jekyll` which I have been pretty happy with in general. Github Pages already uses it, so it made sense to see what I could squeeze out of the two together. You can only use certain themes that Github Pages supports, and there are limitations and workarounds with things like setting up https up and using custom domains. 

This has been workable for me to get something up and running fast, and is probably good for that in general, but I think I'll be graduating to something more flexible relatively soon.
