title: Quick Blog Experiment
---

I created this blog to see how fast I could get a workable blog up and running, using to the maximum extent tools that I use regularly - notably Github & markdown files.

That clearly started me off with `Jekyll` which I have been pretty happy with in general. Github Pages already uses it, so it made sense to see what I could squeeze out of the two together. 

## Github Pages limitations

Github Pages will automatically build and serve your Jekyll site, which is a huge advantage of avoiding the maintenance of your own infrastructure. 

You can only use certain themes that Github Pages supports, but once you get one working for everything, you can tweak it pretty flexibly. There are limitations and workarounds with things like setting up https up and using custom domains. 

## Conclusion

Github Pages has been a workable host to get something up and running fast, and is probably good for that in general, but I think I'll be graduating to something more flexible relatively soon. Jekyll has been quite nice - since I am already working in an IDE with markdown files, and can utilize pull request workflows in Github for blog post publishing, so my next step for something more flexible might be my own instance of Jekyll in a container.
